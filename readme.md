# WD6 Project Portfolio

## Solo Work

The master branch includes my solo work from a previous class called Server-Side Languages that covered PHP.

The dev branch includes what I am currently working on for WD6.

### Quiz 2

This is a simple Grade App for teachers to be able to enter student grades based on percent. Internally, the letter grade is calculated and stored in a MySQL database running on a VM using Vagrant. It has full CRUD functionality and uses the MVC structure.

To run the app locally, you will first need to set up [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/index.html). Then you'll be able to run `vagrant up` to start the VM and you're good to go!

If you want to have a GUI to view the db content, you can setup a program like [SequelPro](https://www.sequelpro.com/). The Vagrantfile will have the IP address and the port that you need. 

## Team Development

My team has decided to use [Fatima's repo](https://github.com/fsheremetyeva/WD6-ProjectPortfolio) for the iMerch team project.
